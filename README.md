# Alkbot

This is a project i made 2 years ago during the lockdown, i am uploading it in case it can inspire others because i had a lot of fun doing it.

My goal was to create a bot to level up league of legends account. 
-it has to keep playing until you manually stop it 
-it mustn't ruin the other players' exeperience (not running mid or following someone 24/7) 
-it must not afk or do nothing (to easy to spot)

So it will play garen, or any other champ if it is not available and play jungle if you do not have smite the bot WILL get executed during its clear. 
Otherwise it should be fine, doing all the camp except the golems and buying items (it even got a kill once)

To run this bot you will need to play in windowed mode with a 1920*1080 resolution 
it will buy the recommanded items by default but you can (and should) create a custom build and setup the shop for it you just need to:
create the custom item set for Garen
create a custom game
pick Garen
open the shop
select custom item set
leave the game

This bot has no graphic interface. You need to prepare the league client on the home page and start the python script.

/!\ Since the S11 items and shop rework the bot is not working properly. 
i have not and don't plan on fixing it since i don't really use it my goal was just to achieve it and it has been done. /!\

Here is a video showing the bot in action: https://youtu.be/AMhiK5tkah8
(i uploaded it with a 300Kb/s ADSL so you understand why the quality is so bad)
